<h2>Is There a Theme?</h2>
<p>The theme for the London Perl Workshop will be "A Perl Christmas". This year we have heard that Perl 6 hope to have a beta release (note: <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/docs/announce/2015.10.md">achieved Oct 2015</a>), and a version 6.0.0 release for Christmas 2015. In honour of that we will be devoting this event to all things related to Perl 6. What effect has Perl 6 had on the ecosystem, the modules, the libraries and the community? What does the future hold for Perl 5 and Perl 6? We will also accept talks and workshops on Perl 5 and Perl 6 related subjects as well as the existing Perl Frameworks and Libraries.</p>
<p>Once again we will be inviting people to run a Hardware hacking event. If you have an idea of an event or goal you would like to achieve to coincide with the London Perl Workshop then please contact the organisers.</p>
<p>We welcome the submission of talks, discussions, presentations and workshops using other languages, or that have separate technical or engineering objectives. The strength in developing is knowledge from a wide variety of sources. If you use another programming language or system to connect physical and virtual devices together and want to submit or attend the event then we would be honoured to welcome you. If you are connected to a UK Hackspace and wish to attend and display then please approach the organisers with ideas of your requirements.</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>If you would like to sponsor the London Perl Workshop then please do not heistate to contact Mark Keating and he will help you with your proposal.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>Speakers are invited to talk on any subject that relates to this theme, though we will also accept talks on other subjects. We will accept talks from people of any age, background or circumstance, the London Perl Workshop is an inclusive event and we would love to have you attend.</p>

<p>This year we hope to have access to three Workshop rooms and would like to run as many workshops as possible. We would also love to refresh the skills of those wishing to engage with the latest developments in the Perl and other languages. If you wish to submit a workshop please use the same submission form as the talks, please note that workshops will be 60, 120 or 240 minutes in length.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Proposal Deadline:</strong> Friday 6th November 2015<br />
	<strong>Speaker Notification:</strong> Monday 22nd November 2015<br />                          

</p>

<p>Please note that we will be starting to accept talks earlier than the proposal deadline and these will be given a priority on the schedule. Talks that match our theme will be given a higher weighting on the schedule.</p>
